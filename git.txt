3. Branches

    From Launchode textbook (https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-professional-web-dev/chapters/git/branches.html)

	22.4.2. Creating a New Branch

	    A programmer is on master and they want to start building a new
	    feature in a new branch. Their first step would be to create a
	    new branch for their work.

	    To create a branch, the command is

		git checkout -b <branch name>

	    By using this command, not only is a new branch created, but
	    also the programmer switches to their new branch.

	22.4.3. Switching to an Existing Branch

	    If the branch already exists, the programmer may want to switch
	    to that branch. To do so, the command is

		git checkout <branch name>
