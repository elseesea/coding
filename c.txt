1. Data types
	From https://www.learn-c.org/en/Variables_and_Types
	
	Integers - whole numbers which can be either positive or negative. Use one of the following:
		char
		int
		short
		long
		long long
	Unsigned integers - whole numbers which can only be positive. Use one of the following:
		unsigned char
		unsigned int
		unsigned short
		unsigned long
		unsigned long long
	Floating point numbers - real numbers (numbers with fractions). Use one of the following:
		float
		double
	Structures - will be explained later, in the Structures section.
	Boolean
		Note that C does not have a boolean type. Usually, it is defined using the following notation:
			#define BOOL char
			#define FALSE 0
			#define TRUE 1
	Strings
		C uses arrays of characters to define strings

2. String concatenation
	From https://www.programmingsimplified.com/c-program-concatenate-strings
	
	strcat(a, b);
		Appends b to a, & stores result in a.
		Requires #include <string.h>
		Does not return a string.
